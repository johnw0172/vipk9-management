PROBLEM: The booking/estimate cancellation isn't working. When user clicks "Cancel" button:
- API calls return 200 success
- But data still exists in database
- Estimate still shows in dashboard
- Booking still shows in calendar

DATABASE DELETE METHODS THAT NEED FIXING:

1. In server/storage-database.ts around line 413-416:
```typescript
async deleteBooking(id: number): Promise<boolean> {
  const result = await db.delete(bookings).where(eq(bookings.id, id));
  return (result.rowCount || 0) > 0;
}
```

2. In server/storage-database.ts around line 486-489:
```typescript
async deleteEstimate(id: number): Promise<boolean> {
  const result = await db.delete(estimates).where(eq(estimates.id, id));
  return (result.rowCount || 0) > 0;
}
```

SYMPTOMS:
- Console shows: "DELETE /api/estimates/1 200" and "DELETE /api/bookings/33 200" 
- But after deletion: "ðŸ“Š ESTIMATES: Returning 1 estimates" (should be 0)
- Database still contains the deleted records

LIKELY ISSUE:
- The delete operations aren't actually removing records from PostgreSQL database
- Possibly missing import statements or incorrect table references
- rowCount check might be failing

WHAT CHATGPT SHOULD FIX:
1. Make sure `estimates` and `bookings` tables are properly imported in storage-database.ts
2. Fix the delete methods to actually remove data from PostgreSQL
3. Ensure the delete operations return proper boolean results
4. Test that when deleteEstimate(1) is called, the estimate actually disappears

The user needs these delete operations to work so cancelled bookings disappear from both the calendar and financial management sections.
